    1) Mark the first element as P in the working set
    2) Read an item while Q is not marked
        If lesser than the previous, keep going: 2)
        If greater or equal than the previous, mark the previous as Q
        If you run out of numbers then it is no real pit, goto 6)
    3) Read an item while R is not marked
        If greater than the previous, keep going: 3)
        If lesser or equal than the previous, mark the one before it as R
        If you run out of numbers, mark the last one as R, goto 4)
    4) Decide if this is better than the best, it's quite simple
    5) Mark the previous element as P in the working set, set Q = R = null, go to 2) if you have any item left
    6) If the best is 0 deep or null, then no pit found
